This is a basic template for anyone needing to quickly setup a 
new website using Link (https://github.com/N11Software/Link)
as a web library.


BUILDING AND RUNNING
Make sure you have Link installed on your system before using
this. You will also need CMake and Ninja on your system. Make
will *probably* work fine but this isn't tested. To build the
site, run

	$ cmake -GNinja .
	$ ninja

This will create the executable 'website' which you can run
with

	$ ./website

which hosts the site at port 3000.

	NOTE: Link doesn't work well natively on Windows and
	will have to run via WSL to work correctly.
